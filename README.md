# Coding-Practice

This repository contains my coding practice solutions from platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**.  
I’m using this repo to improve problem-solving skills, practice algorithms, and document what I’ve learned.

## Goals
- Strengthen algorithms & data structures knowledge
- Practice Big-O complexity analysis
- Build a reference library of solved problems
- Stay consistent with daily problem solving
